# Dog Search App

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Dog Search App is a web application built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Redux. The app allows users to login by providing their name and email. Once authenticated, they can browse available dogs, filter by breed, and paginate through the results. Users can also select their favorite dogs and generate a match using the /dogs/match endpoint.

## Demo

Link to the live demo or a video showcasing the Dog Search App.

## Features

- **Login Screen:** Users can enter their name and email on the login screen.

- **Authentication:** The provided information is used to authenticate with the backend service's login endpoint.

- **Dog Search Page:** Authenticated users are directed to a search page where they can browse available dogs.

  - **Filtering:** Users can filter dogs by breed.

  - **Pagination:** Results are paginated for easy navigation.

  - **Sorting:** Results are sorted alphabetically by breed by default. Users can modify the sort order to be ascending or descending.

  - **Dog Details:** All fields of the Dog object (except for id) are presented.

  - **Favorite Dogs:** Users can select their favorite dogs from the search results.

- **Generate Match:** Users can generate a match by using the /dogs/match endpoint. The match will be a single dog, and the app displays it creatively.
